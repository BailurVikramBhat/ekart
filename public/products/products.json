    "description": "Rare 4500-year-old bronze coin from the Indus Valley Civilization, certified authentic",
    "content": "This extraordinary artifact is a genuine bronze coin from the ancient Harappan civilization, dating back to 2600-1900 BCE during the mature period of the Indus Valley civilization. Meticulously preserved, this coin features characteristic Harappan symbols that offer a tangible connection to one of the world's earliest urban cultures. Certified by the Archaeological Survey of India, it was excavated from the Mohenjo-Daro site in Sindh, Pakistan. The 22mm diameter coin weighs 8.5g and displays remarkable preservation of its original patina and markings. Collectors will appreciate its historical significance as a rare surviving example of early monetary systems. The obverse side bears geometric patterns typical of Harappan craftsmanship, while the reverse shows undeciphered script that continues to puzzle archaeologists. This piece comes with a lifetime authenticity guarantee and detailed provenance documentation. Ideal for serious collectors or museums, it's presented in a protective archival-quality display case with UV-resistant glass. Due to its antiquity and fragile nature, shipping includes specialized packing with climate-controlled options available. A certificate of authenticity signed by a recognized archaeologist accompanies the coin, along with a booklet about Harappan numismatics.",

    "description": "First flush whole leaf tea from certified organic gardens in Assam",
    "content":"Sourced from certified organic estates in Assam's Brahmaputra Valley, these first flush whole leaf teas represent the finest spring harvest of 2023. The rich, malty character characteristic of Assam teas comes through prominently in this batch, with notes of dried fruit and a distinctive coppery liquor. Grown without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, the leaves are hand-plucked by experienced tea pickers who select only the top two leaves and a bud for premium quality. After withering, the leaves undergo careful oxidation to develop their full-bodied flavor before being sorted and packed in nitrogen-flushed foil pouches to preserve freshness. Each 100g package yields approximately 50 cups of robust tea ideal for morning consumption. USDA Organic and India Organic certified, this tea is rich in antioxidants and naturally contains about 50-60mg caffeine per cup. Brewing recommendations: use 1 teaspoon per 200ml water at 90°C (just below boiling) for 3-4 minutes. Can be enjoyed plain or with milk and sweetener. The leaves may be reinfused 2-3 times, with subsequent brews revealing more nuanced flavors. Directly supports sustainable farming communities in Assam through fair trade practices.",
